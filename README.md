# VogellaProject


This a intent project from vogella android tutorial.
In which, the first activity has an EditText which is sent to the next activity on the click of a button.
The second activity would display the text from first activity in the EditText and 
we can change the EditText contents and click the finish button, which would take us to the first Activity
once again and a short toast message would be shown with the text from EditText from the second Activity
